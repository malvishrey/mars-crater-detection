# mars-crater-detection

Leveraged the THEMIS dataset to do Mars crater detection with a two-step pipeline consisting of semantic segmentation through the U2-net model and crater counting of range 2-32 km radius using a template-matching algorithm. Evaluated the model based on the dice coefficient, U2-net outperformed U-net with a 0.73 value.Leveraged the THEMIS dataset to do Mars crater detection with a two-step pipeline consisting of semantic segmentation through the U2-net model and crater counting of range 2-32 km radius using a template-matching algorithm.
